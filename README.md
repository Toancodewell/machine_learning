## Overview

The `model.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the complete process of building a machine learning model, including:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Scaling and normalizing data for optimal model performance.

2. **Feature Engineering and Selection**:
   - Extracting important features.
   - Applying feature selection techniques to improve model accuracy.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Training multiple machine learning models (such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests).
   - Tuning model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Project Setup
